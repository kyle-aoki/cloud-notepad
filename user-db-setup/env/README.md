# User Database Environment Variables Setup and Explaination

In this directory, you must have at least one of three files:

```
environment.dev.json
environment.stage.json
environment.prod.json
```

To develop, provision a free-tier AWS RDS and run `npm run dev`. 
This will set your database up. Use this database to develop the user-api.
